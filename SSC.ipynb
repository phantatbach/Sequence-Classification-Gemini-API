    "  OBJECTIVE\tTo investigate the efficacy of 6 weeks of daily low-dose oral prednisolone in improving pain , mobility , and systemic low-grade inflammation in the short term and whether the effect would be sustained at 12 weeks in older adults with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) .\n",
    "  METHODS\tA total of 125 patients with primary knee OA were randomized 1:1 ; 63 received 7.5 mg/day of prednisolone and 62 received placebo for 6 weeks .\n",
    "  METHODS\tOutcome measures included pain reduction and improvement in function scores and systemic inflammation markers .\n",
    "  METHODS\tPain was assessed using the visual analog pain scale ( 0-100 mm ) .\n",
    "  METHODS\tSecondary outcome measures included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores , patient global assessment ( PGA ) of the severity of knee OA , and 6-min walk distance ( 6MWD ) .\n",
    "  METHODS\tSerum levels of interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - , and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) were measured .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tThere was a clinically relevant reduction in the intervention group compared to the placebo group for knee pain , physical function , PGA , and 6MWD at 6 weeks .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tThe mean difference between treatment arms ( 95 % CI ) was 10.9 ( 4.8-18 .0 ) , p < 0.001 ; 9.5 ( 3.7-15 .4 ) , p < 0.05 ; 15.7 ( 5.3-26 .1 ) , p < 0.001 ; and 86.9 ( 29.8-144 .1 ) , p < 0.05 , respectively .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tFurther , there was a clinically relevant reduction in the serum levels of IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF - , and hsCRP at 6 weeks in the intervention group when compared to the placebo group .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tThese differences remained significant at 12 weeks .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tThe Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials-Osteoarthritis Research Society International responder rate was 65 % in the intervention group and 34 % in the placebo group ( p < 0.05 ) .\n",
    "  CONCLUSIONS\tLow-dose oral prednisolone had both a short-term and a longer sustained effect resulting in less knee pain , better physical function , and attenuation of systemic inflammation in older patients with knee OA ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01619163 ) .\n",

    "  BACKGROUND\tEmotional eating is associated with overeating and the development of obesity .\n",
    "  BACKGROUND\tYet , empirical evidence for individual ( trait ) differences in emotional eating and cognitive mechanisms that contribute to eating during sad mood remain equivocal .\n",
    "  OBJECTIVE\tThe aim of this study was to test if attention bias for food moderates the effect of self-reported emotional eating during sad mood ( vs neutral mood ) on actual food intake .\n",
    "  OBJECTIVE\tIt was expected that emotional eating is predictive of elevated attention for food and higher food intake after an experimentally induced sad mood and that attentional maintenance on food predicts food intake during a sad versus a neutral mood .\n",
    "  METHODS\tParticipants ( N = 85 ) were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental mood induction conditions ( sad/neutral ) .\n",
    "  METHODS\tAttentional biases for high caloric foods were measured by eye tracking during a visual probe task with pictorial food and neutral stimuli .\n",
    "  METHODS\tSelf-reported emotional eating was assessed with the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire ( DEBQ ) and ad libitum food intake was tested by a disguised food offer .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tHierarchical multivariate regression modeling showed that self-reported emotional eating did not account for changes in attention allocation for food or food intake in either condition .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tYet , attention maintenance on food cues was significantly related to increased intake specifically in the neutral condition , but not in the sad mood condition .\n",
    "  CONCLUSIONS\tThe current findings show that self-reported emotional eating ( based on the DEBQ ) might not validly predict who overeats when sad , at least not in a laboratory setting with healthy women .\n",
    "  CONCLUSIONS\tResults further suggest that attention maintenance on food relates to eating motivation when in a neutral affective state , and might therefore be a cognitive mechanism contributing to increased food intake in general , but maybe not during sad mood .\n",

    "  ABSTRACT 4:\n",
    "  OBJECTIVE\tTo evaluate the performance ( efficacy , safety and acceptability ) of a new micro-adherent absorbent dressing ( UrgoClean ) compared with a hydrofiber dressing ( Aquacel ) in the local management of venous leg ulcers , in the debridement stage .\n",
    "  METHODS\tA non-inferiority European randomised controlled clinical trial ( RCT ) was conducted in 37 centres , on patients presenting with venous or predominantly venous , mixed aetiology leg ulcers at their sloughy stage ( with more than 70 % of the wound bed covered with slough at baseline ) .\n",
    "  METHODS\tPatients were followed over a 6-week period and assessed weekly .\n",
    "  METHODS\tThe primary judgement criteria was the relative regression of the wound surface area after the 6-week treatment period .\n",
    "  METHODS\tSecondary endpoints were the relative reduction of sloughy tissue and the percentage of patients presenting with a debrided wound .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tAltogether , 159 patients were randomised to either UrgoClean ( test group ; n = 83 ) or Aquacel ( control group ; n = 76 ) dressings .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tRegarding the wound healing process predictive factors ( wound area , duration , ABPI value , recurrence ) , at baseline , the two groups were well balanced , for both wound and patient characteristics .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tCompression therapy was administered to both groups and after a median 42-day treatment period , the percentage of relative reduction of the wound surface area was very similar ( -36.9 % vs -35.4 % in the UrgoClean and control groups , respectively ) .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tWhen considering the secondary criteria at week 6 , the relative reduction of sloughy tissue was significantly higher in the UrgoClean group than in the control group ( -65.3 % vs -42,6 % ; p = 0.013 ) .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tThe percentage of debrided wounds was also significantly higher in the test group ( 52.5 % vs 35.1 % ; p = 0.033 ) .\n",
    "  CONCLUSIONS\tThis ` EARTH ' RCT confirmed that the UrgoClean dressing has similar efficacy and safety compared to Aquacel .\n",
    "  CONCLUSIONS\tHowever , UrgoClean also showed better autolytic properties than the control group in the management of venous leg ulcers at the sloughy stage .\n",
    "  CONCLUSIONS\tThe new UrgoClean dressing therefore represents a promising therapeutic option within the current range of autolytic dressings available .\n",

    "  OBJECTIVE\tEye movements ( EM ) during recall of an aversive memory is a treatment element unique to Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing ( EMDR ) .\n",
    "  OBJECTIVE\tExperimental studies have shown that EM reduce memory vividness and/or emotionality shortly after the intervention .\n",
    "  OBJECTIVE\tHowever , it is unclear whether the immediate effects of the intervention reflect actual changes in memory .\n",
    "  OBJECTIVE\tThe aim of this study was to test whether immediate reductions in memory vividness and emotionality persist at a 24h follow up and whether the magnitude of these effects is related to the duration of the intervention .\n",
    "  METHODS\tSeventy-three undergraduates recalled two negative autobiographical memories , one with EM ( `` recall with EM '' ) and one without ( `` recall only '' ) .\n",
    "  METHODS\tHalf of participants recalled each memory for four periods of 24s , the other half for eight periods of 24s .\n",
    "  METHODS\tMemory vividness/emotionality were self-rated at a pre-test , an immediate post-test , and a 24h follow-up test .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tIn both duration groups , recall with EM , but not recall only , caused an immediate decrease in memory vividness .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tThere were no immediate reductions in memory emotionality .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tFurthermore , only the ` eight periods ' group showed that recall with EM , but not recall only , caused a decrease in both memory emotionality and memory vividness from the pre-test to the follow-up .\n",
    "  CONCLUSIONS\tOnly self-report measures were used .\n",
    "  CONCLUSIONS\tThe findings suggest that recall with EM causes 24-hchanges in memory vividness/emotionality , which may explain part of the EMDR treatment effect , and these effects are related to intervention duration .\n",

    "  ABSTRACT 10:\n",
    "  BACKGROUND\tYouths with a family history of alcohol and other drug use disorders ( FH + ) are at a greater risk of developing substance use disorders than their peers with no such family histories ( FH - ) , and this increased risk may be related to impaired maturation of forebrain circuitry .\n",
    "  BACKGROUND\tFH + individuals have shown altered forebrain activity at rest and while performing cognitive tasks .\n",
    "  BACKGROUND\tHowever , it is not fully understood how forebrain activity is altered in FH + individuals , and ultimately how these alterations may contribute to substance use disorder risk .\n",
    "  METHODS\tIn this study , we tested 72 FH + and 32 FH - youths performing a go/no-go task and examined activations in blocks with only go trials ( Go Only ) , blocks with 50 % go and 50 % no-go trials ( Go/NoGo ) , and a contrast of those 2 blocks .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tFH + youths had significantly greater cerebral activations in both the Go and Go/NoGo blocks than FH - youths in regions including the posterior cingulate/precuneus , bilateral middle/superior temporal gyrus , and medial superior frontal gyrus with no significant group differences in the subtraction between Go Only and Go/NoGo blocks .\n",
    "  RESULTS\tAdditionally , FH + youths had moderately slower reaction times on go trials in the Go Only blocks .\n",
    "  CONCLUSIONS\tOur findings suggest that global activation increase in FH + youths are modulated by FH density and are not specific to the inhibitory components of the task .\n",
    "  CONCLUSIONS\tThis pattern of increased activations in FH + youths may be at least partially due to impaired forebrain white matter development leading to greater activations/less efficient neural communication during task performance .\n",
